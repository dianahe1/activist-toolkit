        <p class="autismdefinition">
          Autism is a neurological and developmental condition that affects every part of a person. This can mean differences in processing information, sensory sensitivities, anxiety, stimming, and many other characteristics. However, every autistic person is different, and not everyone will have the same needs.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="theproblem">
        Most people do not understand what being autistic truly means. People often think about autism as a "disease" that renders one completely useless, and have a mental image of a small boy playing with toys. Those that do try to help often focus on communication problems within the autistic person, rather than examining how interactions with others and societal factors contribute to the challenges that autistic people face. In truth, autism is simply an essential aspect of identity that needs no cure, and the desire to "normalize" and "cure" autistic people contributes to its stigma.
