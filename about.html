        <p class="infinityexplain">
         The rainbow infinity symbol is linked to the greater neurodiversity movement. Many autistic adults also use a gold infinity to represent autistic acceptance (chemical symbol Au). The puzzle piece has historically been a symbol, but many believe it contributes to the infantilism of autistic people. However, we should listen to those who are actually autistic and their choice in symbolism.

          <p id="autismappendage">Autism is not an appendage.</p>Autism isn't something a person has, or a "shell" that a person is trapped inside. There's no "normal" child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person--and if it were possible, the person you'd have left would not be the same person you started with.<br><br>This is important, so take a moment to consider it: Autism is a way of being. It is not possible to separate the person from the autism.<br><br>Therefore, when parents say,<br><br>I wish my child did not have autism,<br><br> what they're really saying is,<br><br> I wish the autistic child I have did not exist, and I had a different (non-autistic) child instead.<br><br> Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure. This is what we know, when you tell us of your fondest hopes and dreams for us: that your greatest wish is that one day we will cease to be, and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.
